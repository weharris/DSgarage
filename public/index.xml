      <description>Bootcamp overview The purpose of this self-guided, online Bootcamp is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including R Programming, traditional statistical analysis, and open science tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</description>

SCRIPT 1.1 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 We love the R language, but sometimes it is a little bit like talking to a passive aggressive butler - if you aren&amp;rsquo;t careful with your language, the interaction may have unexpected outcomes&amp;hellip;
 R is a programming language and popular open source software design to help non-programmers perform statistical analyses and to make graphs.</description>

 Overview
 R is like a big garage filled with useful tools.
 One of the best things about R is that it can be customized to accomplish a huge variety of kinds of tasks: perform all sorts of statistical analyses from simple to bleeding edge, produce professional graphs, format analyses into presentations, manuscripts and web pages, collaboration, GIS and mapping, and a lot more.</description>

 Overview
 Imagine you are floating in space in the R Global Environment and any data object you can see, you can call on by name to manipulate with functions. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it R Space
 The fundamental way to analyse data in R is to be able to manipuate it with code.</description>

      <description>Analysing data using R can generate complex scripts that might make sense to you while you&amp;rsquo;re actively working on them, but they won&amp;rsquo;t to future you or collaborators. This bootcamp module offers guidance to improve the reproducibility of your code for yourself and others. Following this guidance will also improve your R workflow and reduce errors.

      <description>Data Science Garage
This a repository created to help people do data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others. The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources. The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).</description>
