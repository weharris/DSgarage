      <description>Bootcamp overview The purpose of this self-guided, online Bootcamp is to help get beginners in R started as quickly as possible or to help people with experience refresh their knowledge. There are 3 modules introducing data science skills, including R Programming, traditional statistical analysis, and open science tools. We use R here because it is specifically designed for people with little or no formal programming training, and because it is so good at doing all the things we aim to do.</description>

SCRIPT 1.1 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 We love the R language, but sometimes it is a little bit like talking to a passive aggressive butler - if you aren&amp;rsquo;t careful with your language, the interaction may have unexpected outcomes&amp;hellip;
 R is a programming language and popular open source software design to help non-programmers perform statistical analyses and to make graphs.</description>

 Overview
 R is like a big garage filled with useful tools.
 One of the best things about R is that it can be customized to accomplish a huge variety of kinds of tasks: perform all sorts of statistical analyses from simple to bleeding edge, produce professional graphs, format analyses into presentations, manuscripts and web pages, collaboration, GIS and mapping, and a lot more.</description>

 Overview
 Imagine you are floating in space in the R Global Environment and any data object you can see, you can call on by name to manipulate with functions. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it R Space
 The fundamental way to analyse data in R is to be able to manipuate it with code.</description>

NB for this page we assume you have access to Microsoft Excel; however, similar spreadsheet software (like Libre Office Calc) will work fine.
 Overview
 The first step for getting your data into R is making your data tidy. The first step in using R for data analysis is getting your data into R.</description>

SCRIPT 1.5 Use this to follow along on this page and for the Practice exercises below.
 Overview
 With a good basic set of moves for subsetting and manipulating data, you can overpower any dataset no matter how large and powerful they may be. Then, you will have strong data Sumo.
 Subsetting and manipuating data is probably the commonest activity for anyone who works with data.</description>

      <description>Analysing data using R can generate complex scripts that might make sense to you while you&amp;rsquo;re actively working on them, but they won&amp;rsquo;t to future you or collaborators. This bootcamp module offers guidance to improve the reproducibility of your code for yourself and others. Following this guidance will also improve your R workflow and reduce errors.

      <description>As researchers we often want our collaborators to easily understand what we have done during an analysis. We could just share our raw data and code as it should be reproducible now you&amp;rsquo;ve completed module 3.1. It would be much better to create a reproducible report using RMarkdown that presents your code alongside its output (graphs, tables, etc.) with conventional text to explain it. Of course, reproducible reports aren&amp;rsquo;t just a useful way of sharing analyses with collaborators but can also act as a record for yourself.</description>

      <description>An inescapable fact of science is that it produces a lot of output. This output could be data files, code, figures, tables, manuscripts, etc. Many of these files evolve during the course of a project and often need to be shared with collaborators. Projects can easily spiral out of control without careful management, reducing the quality, reproducibility and reliability of your work. The good news is that this can be mitigated by repurposing tools and workflows typically used by software developers - i.</description>

      <description>Data Science Garage
This a repository created to help people do data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others. The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources. The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).</description>
